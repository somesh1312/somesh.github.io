        <h2>Hello There!</h2>
        <p>I’m a Master’s student in Computer Science at Texas A&M University–Kingsville, specializing in Cloud Engineering, DevOps, and Data Engineering, with a strong foundation in analytics-driven problem solving.</p>
        <p>My work sits at the intersection of cloud infrastructure, automation, and data systems. I design and build scalable, reliable platforms that turn complex workloads into efficient, production-ready solutions.</p>
        <p>I recently attended AWS re:Invent as a Grant Participant, where I deepened my exposure to real-world cloud architectures, serverless systems, and reliability practices used at scale. This experience reinforced my interest in Cloud, DevOps, and SRE-style roles focused on automation, observability, and performance.</p>
        <p>What I’ve Built & Researched
          <ul>
            <li>Master’s Thesis: Reducing Cold Start Latency in Serverless Architectures<br>
              Designed and evaluated AWS Lambda architectures using Redis-based external caching, analyzing latency, cost, and scalability trade-offs.
            </li>
            <li>Cloud & DevOps Projects:<br>
            Built cloud data pipelines, CI/CD workflows, and infrastructure automation using AWS, Terraform, containers, and monitoring tools.</li>
            <li>Data Engineering & Analytics Experience:<br>
              Previously worked as a Data Analyst on financial fraud detection, credit risk modeling, and BI reporting, which sharpened my ability to design data systems that are both technically sound and business-aware.
            </li>
            <li>
              Research & Applied Analytics:
              <ul>
                <li>Banking deserts analysis using QGIS and U.S. Census data</li>
                <li>Economic and CPA exam pass-rate trend analysis across regions
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>What I'm Looking For</p>
        <p>I’m actively seeking full-time opportunities in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cloud Engineering / DevOps / SRE</li>
          <li>Software Engineering (infrastructure & Platform focused)</li>
          <li>Data Engineering</li>
          <li>Cloud-native Analytics & Systems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I thrive in environments where I can build systems end-to-end, automate relentlessly, and collaborate across teams to solve real production problems. I’m especially excited by teams that value ownership, reliability, and continuous learning.</p>

            “I had the pleasure of working with Somesh in his role as a Graduate Research Assistant, where he contributed significantly to multiple data-driven projects under my supervision. The accuracy, quality, and quantity of Somesh's work were superb. His work on banking deserts using QGIS, economic forum survey analysis, and the CPA exam performance study demonstrated both technical ability and strong analytical thinking. The Economic Forum survey analysis relied upon Somesh's collection of survey responses at Harrel's, a popular restaurant in Kingsville. This location is three miles from my office, requiring a special person for this task. I found Somesh to be very dependable and hardworking. In fact, Somesh is the best intern I have had across 14 years of Economic Forums.

Somesh also played a vital role in organizing the Banking and Business Career Expo. He served as the student contact, helping them with registration and mock interview scheduling, and well as maintained the attending recruiter register. He is dependable, detail-oriented, and an excellent collaborator, and I highly recommend him for roles in data and research. Recognizing his talents, it is not surprising that Bay Ltd, one of our top recruiters, tapped him as one of their Summer 2025 interns.

The number of in-office administrative tasks should also be mentioned. I could rely upon him for solutions to technology issues. This included helping me set up my courses in a new management learning system. Any information he saw from faculty recruiting documents to students' grades was always kept confidential. 

Somesh's graduation will be a bitter (impossible to replace), sweet (expecting him to have a great future) day!”

            I have had the pleasure of working with Somesh on an NSF sponsored project (NRT-TREAWS). He showed strong initiative, technical skills, and professionalism while contributing to the early-stage development of a comprehensive web site for the project. As a thesis student, he is tackling a relevant and technically complex research area focused on reducing cold start latency in serverless cloud computing. I’m confident in Somesh’s ability to contribute meaningfully to a variety of data-driven and cloud-focused roles in industry or academia. 

Highlights: <br>
• Contributed to the initial development of the NRT-TREAWS project website.<br>
• Demonstrated strong ownership, clear communication, and initiative during project tasks.<br>
• Currently working under my guidance on a thesis focused on reducing cold start latency in serverless architectures using Redis and AWS Lambda.<br>
• Highly motivated, reliable, and eager to apply academic learning to real-world problems in data and cloud domains.<br>

          To Whom It May Concern,

I am pleased to recommend Somesh. During their time at Bay Ltd., Somesh consistently demonstrated exceptional professionalism, dedication, and a strong work ethic.

In their role as Business Analytics and Corporate Systems Intern, they were responsible for creating new business reports with Power BI and Cognos. He also helped in developing new automation between systems. 

Beyond their technical skills, Somesh is a natural collaborator and a positive presence in the workplace. They communicate clearly, adapt quickly, and consistently go above and beyond expectations.
I do not doubt that Somesh will bring the same level of excellence to any future endeavor.

      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>
        Master’s thesis focused on analyzing and mitigating cold start latency in serverless computing by evaluating caching strategies and architectural trade-offs in AWS Lambda environments.

      <h4>Key Contributions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed controlled experiments comparing no-cache, in-memory cache, and Redis-based external caching</li>
        <li>Measured cold start latency, warm start behavior, and execution overhead</li>
        <li>Analyzed performance vs. cost trade-offs under varying workloads</li>
        <li>Produced reproducible benchmarks and evaluation metrics</li>
